# Apziva Program Projects

This repository contains the project work for my AI Residency Program. Throughout the program, I have worked on various projects to explore and develop my skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Projects
**Project 1:** *Happy Customers*

- Description: Presented with a subset of customer feedback data, predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked.
- Technologies used: 
    - Jupyter notebook 
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - SciPy
    - scikit-learn
    - Hyperopt
- Results: 
    - This project highlighted a success metric of 73% accuracy. This was achieved using both **Logistic Regression** ('*Applied Regularization Parameter*' [13]) and **Random Forests** ('*Minimum Samples Split*' [26]).
    - It was found that the **X2** feature had a negative feature importance ('*Feature Selection*' [15]), and thus **X2** could be safely removed in the next survey.
    - Generally, the default parameters were sufficient for achieving the requested accuracy score, and further attempts at Hyperparameter Tuning via Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization proved ineffective.
